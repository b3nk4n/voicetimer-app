This app allows you to set the timer in a wink, either using its vivid user-interface or using voice command. With just saying _"voiceTIMER for 25 minutes"_, your timer is already set and you can focus on the important things of life while our app is doing the rest. This has never been easier.

You can get the app from the [Windows Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=9747e03a-4f8e-4e42-92d9-ef2251e4a6ed).
